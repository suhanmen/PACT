Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy have flat square blocks with size 1×1, Rainbow Dash has an infinite amount of light blue blocks, Fluttershy has an infinite amount of yellow blocks. \n\nThe blocks are placed according to the following rule: each newly placed block must touch the built on the previous turns figure by a side (note that the outline borders of the grid are built initially). At each turn, one pony can place any number of blocks of her color according to the game rules.\n\nRainbow and Fluttershy have found out that they can build patterns on the grid of the game that way. They have decided to start with something simple, so they made up their mind to place the blocks to form a chess coloring. Rainbow Dash is well-known for her speed, so she is interested in the minimum number of turns she and Fluttershy need to do to get a chess coloring, covering the whole grid with blocks. Please help her find that number!\n\nSince the ponies can play many times on different boards, Rainbow Dash asks you to find the minimum numbers of turns for several grids of the games.\n\nThe chess coloring in two colors is the one in which each square is neighbor by side only with squares of different colors.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T (1 <= T <= 100): the number of grids of the games. \n\nEach of the next T lines contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9): the size of the side of the grid of the game.","grammar":[{"productions":["<S>->[T] <n> <T_T>","<T_i>-><T_i-1> <n> n","<T_1>->n"],"constraints":["1<=T<=100","1<=n<=10^9"]}],"reasoning":["The grammar starts with the initial non-terminal <S>.

Note that the next letter of `z` is `a`.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you perform an operation for the second letter on `aaz`, `aaz` becomes `abz`. If you then perform an operation for the third letter on `abz`, `abz` becomes `aba`.\n\nMr. Takahashi wants to have the lexicographically smallest string after performing exactly K operations on s. Find the such string.\n\nConstraints\n\n* 1<=|s|<=10^5\n* All letters in s are lowercase English letters.\n* 1<=K<=10^9\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n\ns\nK","grammar":[{"productions":["<S>->[a-z]{1,10^5} <n> K"],"constraints":[""]}],"reasoning":["The grammar begins with the start non-terminal <S>. The input consists of a string 's' and an integer 'K'. The string 's' is represented using a regular expression [a-z]{1,10^5} to denote a sequence of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5. The integer 'K' is not a counter variable, so it is represented as 'K' without brackets. The grammar is structured as '<S>->[a-z]{1,10^5} <n> K' to reflect the input format where the string 's' is followed by a newline and then the integer 'K'.<\/think>"]}

The input consists of a string S composed of characters 'N', 'W', 'S', or 'E', with a length between 1 and 1000. Since the length of S is variable and the characters are restricted to these four options, the grammar is represented using a regular expression [NSEW]{1,1000} to denote a string of 1 to 1000 characters, each being one of 'N', 'W', 'S', or 'E'. Thus, the grammar is constructed as '<S>->[NSEW]{1,1000}' to capture the input format directly.<\/think>"]}
