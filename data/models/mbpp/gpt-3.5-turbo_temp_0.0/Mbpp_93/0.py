Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def power(a, b):
    return a ** b

assert power(3, 4) == 81
```

The `power` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the value of `a` raised to the power of `b` using the exponentiation operator `**`. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function returns the expected result.
