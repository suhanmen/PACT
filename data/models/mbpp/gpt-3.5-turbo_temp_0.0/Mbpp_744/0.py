Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def check_none(tup):
    """
    Function to check if the given tuple has any None value or not.
    """
    for item in tup:
        if item is None:
            return True
    return False

assert check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)) == True
```

The `check_none` function takes a tuple as input and iterates over each item in the tuple. If any item is `None`, it returns `True`. If no `None` value is found, it returns `False`. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function behaves as expected.
