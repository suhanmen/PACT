Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def subtract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    result = tuple()
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        result += (tuple1[i] - tuple2[i],)
    return result

assert subtract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
```

The `subtract_elements` function takes in two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and subtracts the elements of `tuple2` from the elements of `tuple1` with the same index. The result is stored in the `result` tuple. The function then returns the `result` tuple.

The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function produces the expected output. In this case, it checks if `subtract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))` is equal to `(8, -1, -13)`. If the condition is true, the program continues execution. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised.
