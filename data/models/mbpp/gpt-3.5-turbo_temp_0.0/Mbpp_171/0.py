Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
    return side_length * 5

assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25
```

The function `perimeter_pentagon` takes in the `side_length` of a regular pentagon and returns the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 5. The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the expected result of 25 when the side length is 5.
