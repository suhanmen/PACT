Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:
            return False
    return True

assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False
```

The `check_smaller` function takes two tuples as input and compares each corresponding element of the second tuple with the first tuple. If any element in the second tuple is greater than or equal to its corresponding element in the first tuple, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if all elements in the second tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the first tuple, the function returns `True`.
