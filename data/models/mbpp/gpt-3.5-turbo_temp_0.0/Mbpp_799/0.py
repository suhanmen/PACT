Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def left_rotate(num, d):
    # Shift the bits to the left by d positions
    rotated_num = (num << d) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    # If the rotated number exceeds 32 bits, wrap around to the beginning
    if rotated_num > 0xFFFFFFFF:
        rotated_num = rotated_num - 0x100000000
    
    return rotated_num

assert left_rotate(16, 2) == 64
```

In this code, the `left_rotate` function takes two parameters: `num` (the number to be rotated) and `d` (the number of bits to rotate by). The function first shifts the bits of `num` to the left by `d` positions using the left shift operator (`<<`). The result is then bitwise ANDed with `0xFFFFFFFF` to ensure that the number remains within 32 bits.

If the rotated number exceeds 32 bits, it means that the leftmost bit has wrapped around to the rightmost bit. In this case, we subtract `0x100000000` (which is equivalent to `2^32`) from the rotated number to wrap it back to the beginning.

Finally, the function returns the rotated number. The `assert` statement at the end of the code snippet verifies that the function produces the expected result for the given example.
