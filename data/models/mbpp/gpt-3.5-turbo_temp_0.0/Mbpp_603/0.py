Here's the completed code snippet:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    lucid_numbers = []
    if n >= 1:
        lucid_numbers.append(1)
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if all(i % num != 0 for num in lucid_numbers):
            lucid_numbers.append(i)
    return lucid_numbers

assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
```

The `get_ludic` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to `n`. It starts by initializing an empty list `lucid_numbers`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it appends 1 to the list since 1 is always a lucid number. 

Then, it iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop. For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by any number in `lucid_numbers`. If `i` is not divisible by any number in `lucid_numbers`, it appends `i` to the list.

Finally, it returns the list of lucid numbers.

The assert statement at the end verifies that the function returns the expected result for the given example.
