Here is the completed code snippet:

```
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    bell = [[0 for j in range(n+1)] for i in range(n+1)]
    bell[0][0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
        
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]
    
    return bell[n][0]

assert bell_number(2) == 2
```

The function `bell_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the Bell numbers.

The code initializes a 2D list `bell` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` and sets the value of `bell[0][0]` to 1. Then, it iterates over the rows and columns of `bell` to calculate the Bell numbers using the recurrence relation `bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]`.

Finally, the function returns the value of `bell[n][0]`, which represents the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers.

The code also includes an assertion to verify that `bell_number(2)` returns the expected result of 2.
