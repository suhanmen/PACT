Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def find_even_pair(lst):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):
            if (lst[i] ^ lst[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

assert find_even_pair([5, 4, 7, 2, 1]) == 4
```

In this code, we define a function `find_even_pair` that takes a list `lst` as input. We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of pairs that xor to an even number.

We use nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of integers in the list. The outer loop iterates over the indices of the list, and the inner loop iterates over the indices that come after the current index in the outer loop. This ensures that we only consider unique pairs.

Inside the inner loop, we use the xor operator `^` to calculate the xor of the two integers at the current indices. We then check if the result is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it is an even number). If it is, we increment the `count` variable.

Finally, we return the `count` variable as the result of the function.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code snippet checks if the function produces the expected result for the given example input.
