Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def check_distinct(t):
    return len(t) == len(set(t))

assert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False
```

In this code, the `check_distinct` function takes a tuple `t` as input. It converts the tuple to a set using the `set()` function, which removes any duplicate elements. Then, it compares the length of the original tuple `t` with the length of the set. If they are equal, it means there are no duplicates in the tuple, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result. In this case, it checks if `check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4))` returns `False`, which is the expected result.
