Here's the completed code snippet:

```python
def sequence(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Invalid input. n must be greater than 0."
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 1
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[dp[i - 1]] + dp[i - dp[i - 1]]
        return dp[n]

assert sequence(10) == 6
```

The function `sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The Newman-Conway sequence is defined as follows:

- P(1) = 1
- P(2) = 1
- For all n > 2, P(n) = P(P(n - 1)) + P(n - P(n - 1))

The code uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the nth number in the sequence. It initializes a list `dp` of size n+1 and sets the base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 1`. Then, it iterates from 3 to n, calculating each subsequent number in the sequence using the recurrence relation. Finally, it returns `dp[n]`, which is the nth number in the sequence.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code snippet verifies that `sequence(10)` returns the expected result of 6.
