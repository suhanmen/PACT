Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def find(a, b):
    return a // b

assert find(10, 3) == 3
```

The `find` function takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and uses the `//` operator to perform integer division. This operator returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, rounded down to the nearest integer. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function returns the expected result.
