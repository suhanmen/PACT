Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def prime_num(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

assert prime_num(13) == True
```

In this code, the function `prime_num` takes an integer `num` as input and checks if it is a prime number. It returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, as prime numbers are greater than 1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it immediately returns `False`.

Next, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive) using a for loop. It checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in this range. If it is divisible by any number, it means the number is not prime and the function returns `False`.

If the number is not divisible by any number in the range, it means the number is prime and the function returns `True`.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code snippet checks if the function returns `True` for the given test case `prime_num(13)`. If the function returns `True`, the assertion passes and no error is raised.
