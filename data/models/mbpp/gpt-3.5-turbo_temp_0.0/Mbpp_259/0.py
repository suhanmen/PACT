Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def maximize_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    result = []
    for t1, t2 in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        max_tuple = tuple(max(x, y) for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
        result.append(max_tuple)
    return tuple(result)

assert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))
```

The `maximize_elements` function takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the maximum value from the corresponding elements in the input tuples. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously. The `max` function is then used to find the maximum value for each pair of elements. The resulting maximum values are stored in a new tuple, which is then returned as the final result. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function produces the expected output.
