Here's the completed code snippet:

```python
def count_divisors(num):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count % 2 == 0

assert count_divisors(10)
```

This code defines a function `count_divisors` that takes a number `num` as input. It then iterates through all numbers from 1 to `num` and checks if `num` is divisible by each number. If it is, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code snippet checks if `count_divisors(10)` returns `True`. If it does, the program continues execution. If it doesn't, an `AssertionError` is raised.
