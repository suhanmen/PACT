Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    result = tuple()
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        result += (tuple1[i] / tuple2[i],)
    return result

assert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)
```

The `division_elements` function takes in two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and performs element-wise division operation across the tuples. It creates an empty tuple `result` to store the division results. Then, it iterates over the indices of the tuples using a for loop and divides the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. The division result is added to the `result` tuple using the `+=` operator. Finally, the `result` tuple is returned.

The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function returns the expected result. In this case, it checks if `division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` is equal to `(2, 2, 2, 3)`. If the condition is true, the program continues execution. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised.
