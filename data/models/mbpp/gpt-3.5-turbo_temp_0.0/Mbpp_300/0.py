Here's the completed code snippet:

```python
import math

def count_binary_seq(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0, there is only one possible binary sequence
    if n == 0:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: count the number of binary sequences by summing the counts of two subproblems
    return 2 * count_binary_seq(n - 1)

# Test the function
assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)
```

In this code, the `count_binary_seq` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of all binary sequences of length `2n` such that the sum of the first `n` bits is the same as the sum of the last `n` bits.

The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case there is only one possible binary sequence (either "00" or "11").

For the recursive case, the function calls itself with `n - 1` to count the number of binary sequences for the subproblem of length `2(n-1)`. Since each bit can be either 0 or 1, there are two possibilities for each bit, so the count is multiplied by 2.

The function uses the `math.isclose` function to assert that the result is approximately equal to 2.0, with a relative tolerance of 0.001.
