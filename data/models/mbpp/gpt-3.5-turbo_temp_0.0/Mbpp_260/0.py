Here's the completed code snippet:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 0
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num) and is_prime(2**num - 1):
            count += 1
    return num

assert newman_prime(3) == 7
```

The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if there are any divisors. The `newman_prime` function finds the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number by incrementing a number and checking if it is both a prime number and if 2 raised to that number minus 1 is also a prime number. The function keeps track of the count of found Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers and returns the last number found. The assertion at the end verifies that the function returns the correct result for the given example.
