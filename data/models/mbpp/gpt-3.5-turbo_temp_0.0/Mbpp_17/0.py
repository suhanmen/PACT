Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length

assert square_perimeter(10) == 40
```

The function `square_perimeter` takes the side length of a square as input and returns its perimeter. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4. The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the expected result of 40 when the side length is 10.
