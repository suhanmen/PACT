Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(set(tuple1) ^ set(tuple2))

assert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)
```

In this code, the `find_dissimilar` function takes two tuples as input. It converts both tuples to sets using the `set()` function, which removes any duplicate elements. Then, it uses the symmetric difference operator `^` to find the dissimilar elements between the two sets. Finally, it converts the resulting set back to a tuple using the `tuple()` function and returns it.

The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function returns the expected result. If the result is not as expected, an `AssertionError` will be raised.
