Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def closest_num(n):
    return n - 1

assert closest_num(11) == 10
```

The function `closest_num` takes a number `n` as input and returns the closest smaller number by subtracting 1 from `n`. The assertion `assert closest_num(11) == 10` checks if the function returns the expected result.
