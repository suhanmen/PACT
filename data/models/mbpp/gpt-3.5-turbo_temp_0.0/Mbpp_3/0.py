Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def is_not_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return True
    return False

assert is_not_prime(2) == False
```

The `is_not_prime` function takes a number as input and checks if it is a non-prime number. It returns `True` if the number is non-prime and `False` if it is prime.

In the function, we first check if the number is less than 2. If it is, we return `True` because numbers less than 2 are not prime.

Next, we iterate from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive) using a for loop. We check if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in this range. If it is, we return `True` because it means the number is not prime.

If the loop completes without finding any divisors, we return `False` because it means the number is prime.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code snippet checks if `is_not_prime(2)` returns `False` as expected. If it does, the assertion passes silently. If it doesn't, an `AssertionError` is raised.
