Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    # Create an empty dictionary
    d = {}
    
    # Iterate over the tuple elements
    for i in range(0, len(t)-1, 2):
        # Add the adjacent elements as key-value pairs to the dictionary
        d[t[i]] = t[i+1]
    
    # Return the dictionary
    return d

# Test the function
assert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}
```

This function takes a tuple as input and converts it into a dictionary by pairing adjacent elements. The function iterates over the tuple using a step size of 2, and adds the current element as a key and the next element as its corresponding value to the dictionary. Finally, the function returns the resulting dictionary.
