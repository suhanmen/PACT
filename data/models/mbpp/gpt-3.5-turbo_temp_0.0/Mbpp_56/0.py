Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def check(num):
    reverse = int(str(num)[::-1])
    return num == 2 * reverse - 1
```

This function takes a number as input and checks if it is one less than twice its reverse. It does this by converting the number to a string, reversing the string, and converting it back to an integer. Then it compares the original number with twice the reverse minus one. If they are equal, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

The assert statement at the end of the code snippet checks if the function returns the expected result for the given example.
