Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    opening_brackets = ['(', '{', '[']
    closing_brackets = [')', '}', ']']
    
    for char in expression:
        if char in opening_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in closing_brackets:
            if not stack:
                return False
            else:
                top = stack.pop()
                if opening_brackets.index(top) != closing_brackets.index(char):
                    return False
    
    if stack:
        return False
    else:
        return True

assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True
```

This function uses a stack to check if the given expression is balanced or not. It iterates through each character in the expression and if it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or not. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so the expression is not balanced. If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element from the stack and checks if the opening and closing brackets match. If they don't match, the expression is not balanced. After iterating through all the characters, if the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the expression is not balanced. Otherwise, the expression is balanced.
