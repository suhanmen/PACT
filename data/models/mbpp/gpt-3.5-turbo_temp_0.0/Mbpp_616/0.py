Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(x % y for x, y in zip(tuple1, tuple2))

assert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)
```

In this code, the `tuple_modulo` function takes two tuples as input. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the two tuples. For each pair of elements, it calculates the modulo using the `%` operator and creates a new tuple with the results. Finally, it returns the resulting tuple.

The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function produces the expected output. In this case, it checks if the result of `tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5))` is equal to `(0, 4, 5, 1)`. If the condition is true, the program continues execution. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised.
