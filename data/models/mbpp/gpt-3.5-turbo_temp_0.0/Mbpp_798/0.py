Here's the completed code snippet:

```python
def _sum(arr):
    return sum(arr)

assert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6
```

The `_sum` function takes an array as input and uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the elements in the array. The `assert` statement checks if the result of calling `_sum` with the input `[1, 2, 3]` is equal to `6`.
