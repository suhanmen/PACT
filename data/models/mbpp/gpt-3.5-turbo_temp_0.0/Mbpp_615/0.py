Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def average_tuple(tuples):
    averages = []
    for tup in tuples:
        average = sum(tup) / len(tup)
        averages.append(average)
    return averages

assert average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
```

The `average_tuple` function takes a tuple of tuples as input. It iterates over each tuple in the input and calculates the average value by summing all the elements in the tuple and dividing by the length of the tuple. The calculated average is then appended to the `averages` list. Finally, the function returns the `averages` list.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code snippet verifies that the function produces the expected output.
