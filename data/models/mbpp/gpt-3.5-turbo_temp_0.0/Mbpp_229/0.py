Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def re_arrange_array(arr, n):
    # Separate negative and positive elements
    negatives = [x for x in arr[:n] if x < 0]
    positives = [x for x in arr[:n] if x >= 0]

    # Combine negative and positive elements while preserving relative order
    return negatives + positives

assert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], 9) == [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]
```

In this code, we first separate the negative and positive elements from the given array using list comprehensions. We iterate over the first `n` elements of the array and add the negative elements to the `negatives` list and the positive elements to the `positives` list.

Finally, we combine the `negatives` and `positives` lists while preserving the relative order by concatenating them using the `+` operator.

The `assert` statement checks if the output of the `re_arrange_array` function matches the expected output and raises an error if they are not equal.
