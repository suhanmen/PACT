Here's the completed code snippet:

```python
def largest_subset(numbers):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the count of remainders
    remainders = {}

    # Iterate through the numbers and count the remainders
    for num in numbers:
        remainder = num % 3
        if remainder in remainders:
            remainders[remainder] += 1
        else:
            remainders[remainder] = 1

    # Check if there is a pair of numbers with remainder 0
    if 0 in remainders:
        subset_size = remainders[0]
    else:
        subset_size = 0

    # Check if there is a pair of numbers with remainder 1 and remainder 2
    if 1 in remainders and 2 in remainders:
        subset_size += min(remainders[1], remainders[2])

    return subset_size

assert largest_subset([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
```

In this code, we use a dictionary `remainders` to store the count of remainders when dividing each number by 3. We iterate through the numbers and update the count in the dictionary accordingly.

To find the size of the largest subset, we check if there is a pair of numbers with remainder 0. If so, we add the count of numbers with remainder 0 to the subset size.

Next, we check if there is a pair of numbers with remainder 1 and remainder 2. If both remainders exist in the dictionary, we add the minimum count of numbers with remainder 1 and remainder 2 to the subset size.

Finally, we return the subset size as the result. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function returns the expected result for the given example.
