Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def and_tuples(tup1, tup2):
    result = tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    return result

assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
```

The `and_tuples` function takes two tuples as input and uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the two tuples. It then performs the bitwise AND operation (`&`) on each pair of elements and stores the results in a new tuple called `result`. Finally, the function returns the `result` tuple.

The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function produces the expected output. In this case, it checks if `and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` is equal to `(0, 0, 2, 1)`. If the condition is true, the program continues execution. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised.
