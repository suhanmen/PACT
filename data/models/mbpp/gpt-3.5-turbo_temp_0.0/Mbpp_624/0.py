Here is the completed code snippet:

```python
def is_upper(string):
    return string.upper()

assert is_upper("person") == "PERSON"
```

The `is_upper` function takes a string as input and uses the `upper()` method to convert it to uppercase. The `assert` statement checks if the result of calling `is_upper("person")` is equal to the expected value "PERSON".
