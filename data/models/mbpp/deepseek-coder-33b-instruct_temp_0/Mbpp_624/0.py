Here is the Python function to convert a given string to uppercase:

```python
def to_upper(s):
    return s.upper()

# Test the function
assert to_upper("person") == "PERSON"
```

In this function, the `upper()` method is used to convert all the characters in the string to uppercase. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the condition in the `assert` statement is `True`, the program continues to execute. If the condition is `False`, the program raises an `AssertionError`.
