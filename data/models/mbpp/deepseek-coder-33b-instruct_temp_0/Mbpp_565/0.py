Here is the Python function to split a string into characters:

```python
def split(s):
    return list(s)

# Test the function
assert split('python') == ['p','y','t','h','o','n']
```

This function uses the built-in `list()` function in Python, which converts a string into a list of characters. The `list()` function takes a string as an argument and returns a list where each character of the string is an element of the list.
