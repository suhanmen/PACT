Here is the Python function to find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides:

```python
def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
    return 5 * side_length
```

You can test this function with the following code:

```python
print(perimeter_pentagon(5))  # Output: 25
```

This function works by multiplying the length of one side of the pentagon by 5, since a pentagon has 5 sides.
