Sure, here is the Python function to check if a given number is a Woodall number or not.

```python
def is_woodall(n):
    """
    This function checks if a given number is a Woodall number or not.
    A number n is a Woodall number if n can be expressed in the form of 2^(n-1)*n-1.
    """
    def is_power_of_two(n):
        """
        This function checks if a given number is a power of two or not.
        """
        return n and (not(n & (n - 1)))

    if n < 1:
        return False

    n -= 1
    if is_power_of_two(n+1) and (n & (n+1)):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test the function
print(is_woodall(383))  # Output: True
```

In this function, we first check if the number is a power of two. If it is, we then check if the number and its predecessor have a bitwise AND operation of 1. If both conditions are true, then the number is a Woodall number.
