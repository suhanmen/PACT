Here is the Python function to find the area of a rectangle:

```python
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    """
    This function calculates the area of a rectangle.
    """
    return length * width
```

You can test the function with the following code:

```python
assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200
```

This code will raise an `AssertionError` if the function does not return the expected result.
