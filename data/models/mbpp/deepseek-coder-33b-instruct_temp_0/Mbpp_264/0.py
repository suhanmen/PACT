Sure, here is the Python function in a markdown style code block:

```python
def dog_age(human_years):
    """
    Function to calculate a dog's age in dog's years.
    """
    return human_years * 7

# Test the function
assert dog_age(12)==84
```

This function takes the dog's age in human years as an argument and returns the equivalent age in dog's years. The conversion rate is 1 human year equals 7 dog years.
