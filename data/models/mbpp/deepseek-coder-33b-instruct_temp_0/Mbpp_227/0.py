Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a, b, c)

# Test the function
assert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0
```

This function uses the built-in `min` function in Python to find the minimum of three numbers. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the minimum of 10, 20, and 0 is not 0, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.
