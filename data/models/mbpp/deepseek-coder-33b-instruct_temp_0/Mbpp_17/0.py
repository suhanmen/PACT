Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    """
    This function calculates the perimeter of a square given its side length.
    """
    return 4 * side_length

# Test the function
assert square_perimeter(10) == 40
```

In this code, the function `square_perimeter` takes one argument, `side_length`, which represents the length of one side of the square. The function then returns the perimeter of the square, which is calculated as four times the side length. The assertion at the end of the code block tests the function with an input of 10 and expects the output to be 40.
