Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def check(n):
    """
    This function checks if a given number is one less than twice its reverse.
    """
    # Reverse the number
    reversed_n = int(str(n)[::-1])

    # Check if the number is one less than twice its reverse
    if n == 2 * reversed_n - 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

You can use this function to check if a number satisfies the condition:

```python
print(check(70))  # Output: False
```
