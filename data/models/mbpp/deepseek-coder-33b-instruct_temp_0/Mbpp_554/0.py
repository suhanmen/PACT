Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def Split(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]
```

This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list and only include the numbers that are not divisible by 2 (i.e., the odd numbers).
