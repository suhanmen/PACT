Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def count_X(tup, x):
    return tup.count(x)

# Test the function
assert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0
```

This function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples in Python to count the occurrences of a specific element in the tuple. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the given example.
