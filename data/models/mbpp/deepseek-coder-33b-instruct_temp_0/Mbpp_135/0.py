Here is the Python function to find the nth hexagonal number:

```python
def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (2 * n - 1)
```

You can test the function with the following code:

```python
print(hexagonal_num(10))  # Output: 190
```

This function works by using the formula for the nth hexagonal number, which is n*(2n-1).
