Here is the Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))
```

This function uses the built-in `zip` function to pair up the elements from the two input tuples. It then uses a generator expression to create a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements from the input tuples.

You can test the function with the provided test case:

```python
print(and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)))  # Output: (0, 0, 2, 1)
```

This will output `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is the expected result.
