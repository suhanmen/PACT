Here is the Python function to set the left most unset bit:

```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    # If all bits are set, return the number itself
    if n == ((1 << n.bit_length()) - 1):
        return n

    # Find the leftmost unset bit
    for i in range(n.bit_length()):
        if not (n & (1 << i)):
            return n | (1 << i)

    # If no unset bit is found, return the number itself
    return n
```

You can test the function with the following code:

```python
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14
```

This function works by first checking if all bits are set. If they are, it returns the number itself. If not, it finds the leftmost unset bit and sets it. If no unset bit is found, it returns the number itself.
