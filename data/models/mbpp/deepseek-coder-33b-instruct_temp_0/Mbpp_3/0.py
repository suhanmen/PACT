Here is the Python function to identify non-prime numbers:

```python
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    elif n <= 3:
        return False
    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return True
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return True
        i += 6
    return False
```

This function works by checking divisibility by 2 and 3, then checking for divisibility by all numbers of the form 6k Â± 1 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.

You can test this function with the following code:

```python
print(is_not_prime(2))  # False
print(is_not_prime(4))  # True
print(is_not_prime(17))  # False
print(is_not_prime(25))  # True
```

This will output:

```
False
True
False
True
```

This indicates that the function is working as expected.
