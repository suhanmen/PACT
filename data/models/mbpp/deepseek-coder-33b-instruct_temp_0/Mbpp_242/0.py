Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def count_charac(input_string):
    """
    Write a function to count the total number of characters in a string.
    """
    return len(input_string)

# Test the function
assert count_charac("python programming")==18
```

In this function, we use the built-in `len()` function in Python, which returns the number of items in an object. When the object is a string, `len()` returns the number of characters in the string.
