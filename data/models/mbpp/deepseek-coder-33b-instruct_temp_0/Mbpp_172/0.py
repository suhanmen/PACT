Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def count_occurance(input_string):
    return input_string.count('std')

# Test the function
assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3
```

This function uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of a substring in the given string.
