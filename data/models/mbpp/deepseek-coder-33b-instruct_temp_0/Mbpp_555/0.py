Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_of_cubes = sum([i**3 for i in range(1, n+1)])
    sum_of_numbers = sum([i for i in range(1, n+1)])
    return sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers

# Test the function
assert difference(3) == 30
```

This function first calculates the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers separately. It then returns the difference between these two sums. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the given example.
