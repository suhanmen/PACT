Here is the Python function to find the sum of an array:

```python
def _sum(arr):
    return sum(arr)

# Test the function
assert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6
```

In this function, we use the built-in `sum` function in Python to calculate the sum of the elements in the array. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the result of the function is not equal to 6, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.
