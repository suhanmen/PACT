Here is the Python function to find squares of individual elements in a list:

```python
def square_nums(nums):
    return [num ** 2 for num in nums]
```

You can test this function with the following code:

```python
print(square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))
```

This should output:

```python
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```
