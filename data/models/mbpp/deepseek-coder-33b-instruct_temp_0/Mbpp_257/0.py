Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def swap_numbers(num1, num2):
    return (num2, num1)

# Test the function
assert swap_numbers(10,20)==(20,10)
```

In this function, we simply return a tuple with the second number first and then the first number. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function is implemented correctly, the `assert` statement will not raise an `AssertionError`.
