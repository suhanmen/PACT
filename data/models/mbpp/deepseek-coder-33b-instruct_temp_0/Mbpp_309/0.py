Here is the Python function to find the maximum of two numbers:

```python
def maximum(a, b):
    """
    This function returns the maximum of two numbers.
    """
    if a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
```

You can test the function with the following code:

```python
assert maximum(5,10) == 10
```
