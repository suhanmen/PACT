Here is the Python function implemented in a markdown style code block:

```python
def add_tuple(lst, tpl):
    """
    Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
    """
    return lst + list(tpl)

# Test the function
print(add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)))  # Expected output: [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
```

In this function, we use the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple. The tuple is first converted to a list using the `list()` function. The result is a new list that includes all elements from the original list and the tuple.
