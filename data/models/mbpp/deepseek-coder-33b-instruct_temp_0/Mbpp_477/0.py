Here is the Python function to convert the given string to lower case:

```python
def is_lower(s):
    return s.lower()

assert is_lower("InValid") == "invalid"
```

In this function, the `lower()` method is used to convert all the uppercase characters in a string into lowercase characters and returns the string. The `assert` statement is used to test if the function is working as expected.
