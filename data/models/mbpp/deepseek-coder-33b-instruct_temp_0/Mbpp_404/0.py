Here is the Python function to find the minimum of two numbers:

```python
def minimum(a, b):
    """
    This function returns the minimum of two numbers.
    """
    return min(a, b)

# Test the function
assert minimum(1,2) == 1
```

In this function, we use the built-in `min()` function in Python to find the minimum of two numbers. The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the minimum of 1 and 2 is not 1, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.
