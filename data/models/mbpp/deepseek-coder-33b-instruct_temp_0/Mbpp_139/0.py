Here is the Python function to find the circumference of a circle:

```python
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```

You can use the `math.isclose` function to compare the result of `circle_circumference(10)` with `62.830000000000005` with a relative tolerance of `0.001`.

```python
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius

assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)
```

This code will raise an `AssertionError` if the two values are not close enough according to the specified relative tolerance. If the assertion passes, it means the function is working correctly.
