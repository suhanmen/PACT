def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
        Output: [1]

    # We will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path of length k 
    # from any cell of the grid to every other cell in the grid.
    # For this, we will represent each cell of the grid as a node in a graph,
    # and the edges between the nodes will have weights equal to the absolute
    # difference between the values of the cells connected by the edge.
    # Then, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path of length k
    # from any node to every other node.

    # First, we need to transform the grid into a graph representation.
    # We will use a dictionary to store the graph, where the keys are the nodes
    # and the values are dictionaries that represent the edges of each node.
