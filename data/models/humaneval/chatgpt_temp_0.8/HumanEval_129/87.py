One possible implementation of the function is:

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    if k == 1:
        # Return the smallest value in the grid
        return [min(min(row) for row in grid)]
    else:
        # Use dynamic programming to find the minimum path
        # of length k that ends at each cell of the grid
        dp = [[[[] for _ in range(k)] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                dp[i][j][0] = [grid[i][j]]
                for t in range(1, k):
                    for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and len(dp[ni][nj][t-1]) > 0:
                            path = dp[ni][nj][t-1] + [grid[i][j]]
                            if len(dp[i][j][t]) == 0 or path < dp[i][j][t]:
                                dp[i][j][t] = path
        # Return the lexicographically smallest path of length k
        return min(dp[i][j][-1] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) i
