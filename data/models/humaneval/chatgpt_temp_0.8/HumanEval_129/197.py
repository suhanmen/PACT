# We can solve this problem using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm
# We will maintain a priority queue (heap) containing tuples of the form (distance, path, current_cell)
# The distance is the lexicographically smallest path found so far to reach the current cell with the given length
# The path is the list of values visited so far on this path
# The current_cell is the cell we are currently at
