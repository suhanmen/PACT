def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal

    Args:
    l (list): A list of integers

    Returns:
    list: A modified list such that values at indices divisible by 3 are sorted while other values are unchanged.
    
    Examples:
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
