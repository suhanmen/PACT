    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit. This basket contains apples, oranges, and 
    mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of the oranges and apples 
    and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits in the basket, return the 
    number of the mango fruits in the basket.
