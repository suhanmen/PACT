    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """
    # We can assume that the cars are numbered from 0 to n-1
    # and that their speed is normalized to 1 (i.e. they move 1 unit of distance per time unit)
    # Let's consider the time it takes for the two cars to meet, assuming they move towards each other.
    # We can represent the position of the left-to-right car i as (i, 0) and the position of the
    # right-to-left car j as (j, t) where t is the time it takes to meet.
    # If the two cars meet at position (x, y), then we have:
    # i + t = j - t   (because their distances from (0, 0) are equal)
    # x = i + t
    # y = t
    # and also:
    # j + t = i - t   (because their distances from (0, 0) are equal)
    # x = j - t
    # y = t
    # Solving these equations, we get:
    # t = (j - i) / 2
    # x = (i + j) / 2
    # y = t
    # Note that t must be positive and integer, and that x must be an integer.
    # Therefore, for each car i, we need to find the number of cars j such that (j - i) is even and positive.
    # This can be done by dividing the range of cars [0, n-1] into two sets: even and odd.
    # Then, for each car i in the even set, we count the number of cars in the odd set that are greater than i.
    # The total number of collisions is the sum of all such counts.
    count = 0
    odd_cars = set(range(1, n, 2))
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        count += sum(1 for j in odd_cars if j > i)
